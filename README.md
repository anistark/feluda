ðŸ”Ž **Feluda** is a Rust-based command-line tool that analyzes the dependencies of a project, notes down their licenses, and flags any permissions that restrict personal or commercial usage or are incompatible with your project's license.

![ss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/473908eb-43cb-4c4f-86aa-017de251afa8)

> ðŸ‘‹ It's still highly experimental, but fast iterating. Welcoming contributors and support to help bring out this project even better!

## Features

- Parse your project to identify dependencies and their licenses.
- Classify licenses into permissive, restrictive, or unknown categories.
- Check license compatibility between dependencies and your project's license.
- Flag dependencies with licenses that may restrict personal or commercial use.
- Flag dependencies with licenses that may be incompatible with your project's license.
- Output results in plain text, JSON or TUI formats. There's also a gist format which is available in strict mode to output a single line only.
- CI/CD support for Github Actions and Jenkins.
- Verbose mode gives an enhanced view of all licenses.

```

</details>

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the tool in the project directory:

```sh
feluda
```

### Specify a Path to your project directory

```sh
feluda --path /path/to/project/
```

_If you're using Feluda, feel free to grab a Scanned with Feluda badge for your project:_ [![Scanned with Feluda](https://img.shields.io/badge/Scanned%20with-Feluda-red)](https://github.com/anistark/feluda)

```

### Output Format

- Default: Plain text.
- JSON: Use the `--json` flag for JSON output.

```sh
feluda --json
```

Sample Output for a sample cargo.toml file containing `serde` and `tokio` dependencies:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "serde",
    "version": "1.0.151",
    "license": "MIT",
    "is_restrictive": false,
    "compatibility": "Compatible"
  },
  {
    "name": "tokio",
    "version": "1.0.2",
    "license": "MIT",
    "is_restrictive": false,
    "compatibility": "Compatible"
  }
]
```

- YAML: Use the `--yaml` flag for YAML output.

```sh
feluda --yaml
```

Sample Output for a sample cargo.toml file containing `serde` and `tokio` dependencies:

```yaml
- name: serde
  version: 1.0.151
  license: MIT
  is_restrictive: false
  compatibility: Compatible
- name: tokio
  version: 1.0.2
  license: MIT
  is_restrictive: false
  compatibility: Compatible
```

### Verbose Mode

For detailed information about each dependency:

```sh
feluda --verbose
```

### License Compatibility

Feluda can check if dependency licenses are compatible with your project's license:

```sh
feluda --project-license MIT
```

You can also filter for incompatible licenses only:

```sh
feluda --incompatible
```

And fail CI builds if incompatible licenses are found:

```sh
feluda --fail-on-incompatible
```

### Strict Mode

In case you strictly need only the restrictive dependencies:

```sh
feluda --strict
```

### TUI Mode

We've an awesome âœ¨ TUI mode available to browse through the dependencies in a visually appealing way as well:

```sh
feluda --gui
```

## CI/CD Integration

Feluda provides several options for CI integration:

- `--ci-format <github|jenkins>`: Generate output compatible with the specified CI system
- `--fail-on-restrictive`: Make the CI build fail when restrictive licenses are found
- `--fail-on-incompatible`: Make the CI build fail when incompatible licenses are found
- `--output-file <path>`: Write the output to a file instead of stdout

Feluda can be easily integrated into your CI/CD pipelines with built-in support for **GitHub Actions** and **Jenkins**.

### GitHub Actions

To use Feluda with GitHub Actions, create a `.github/workflows/feluda.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
name: License Check

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  check-licenses:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Rust
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          profile: minimal
          toolchain: stable
          override: true

      - name: Install Feluda
        run: cargo install feluda

      - name: Check licenses
        run: feluda --ci-format github --fail-on-restrictive --fail-on-incompatible
```

## Configuration

Feluda allows you to customize which licenses are considered restrictive through configuration. This can be done in three ways, listed in order of precedence (highest to lowest):

1. Environment variables
2. `.feluda.toml` configuration file
3. Default values

### Default Restrictive Licenses

By default, Feluda considers the following licenses as restrictive:
- GPL-3.0
- AGPL-3.0
- LGPL-3.0
- MPL-2.0
- SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE
- CC-BY-SA-4.0
- EPL-2.0

### Configuration File

Create a `.feluda.toml` file in your project root to override the default restrictive licenses:

```toml
[licenses]
# Override the default list of restrictive licenses
restrictive = [
    "GPL-3.0",      # GNU General Public License v3.0
    "AGPL-3.0",     # GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
    "Custom-1.0",   # Your custom license identifier
]
```

### Environment Variables

You can also override the configuration using environment variables:

```sh
# Override restrictive licenses list
export FELUDA_LICENSES_RESTRICTIVE='["GPL-3.0","AGPL-3.0","Custom-1.0"]'
```

The environment variables take precedence over both the configuration file and default values.
