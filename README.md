## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system.

If you already had it, make sure it's up-to-date and update if needed.

### Clone and Build

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anistark/feluda.git
cd feluda

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Add Feluda to your PATH (optional)
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the tool in the project directory:

```sh
feluda
```

### Specify a Path to your project directory

```sh
feluda --path /path/to/project/
```

### Output Format

- Default: Plain text.
- JSON: Use the `--json` flag for JSON output.

```sh
feluda --json
```

Sample Output for a sample cargo.toml file containing `serde` and `tokio` dependencies:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "serde",
    "version": "1.0.151",
    "license": "MIT",
    "is_restrictive": false
  },
  {
    "name": "tokio",
    "version": "1.0.2",
    "license": "MIT",
    "is_restrictive": false
  }
]
```

### Verbose Mode

For detailed information about each dependency:

```sh
feluda --verbose
```

### Strict Mode

In case you strictly need only the restrictive dependencies:

```sh
feluda --strict
```
