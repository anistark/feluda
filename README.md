ðŸ”Ž **Feluda** is a Rust-based command-line tool that analyzes the dependencies of a project, notes down their licenses, and flags any permissions that restrict personal or commercial usage.

![ss-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bda9fb10-3e6b-4881-b852-58ab33341dcd)

> ðŸ‘‹ It's still highly experimental, but fast iterating. Welcoming contributors and support to help bring out this project even better!

## Features

- Parse your project to identify dependencies and their licenses.
- Classify licenses into permissive, restrictive, or unknown categories.
- Flag dependencies with licenses that may restrict personal or commercial use.
- Output results in plain text, JSON or TUI formats. There's also a gist format which is available in strict mode to output a single line only.

```

Sample Output for a sample cargo.toml file containing `serde` and `tokio` dependencies:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "serde",
    "version": "1.0.151",
    "license": "MIT",
    "is_restrictive": false
  },
  {
    "name": "tokio",
    "version": "1.0.2",
    "license": "MIT",
    "is_restrictive": false
  }
]
```

### Verbose Mode

For detailed information about each dependency:

```sh
feluda --verbose
```

### Strict Mode

In case you strictly need only the restrictive dependencies:

```sh
feluda --strict
```

### TUI Mode

We've an awesome âœ¨ TUI mode available to browse through the dependencies in a visually appealing way as well:

```sh
feluda --gui
```

## Configuration

Feluda allows you to customize which licenses are considered restrictive through configuration. This can be done in three ways, listed in order of precedence (highest to lowest):

1. Environment variables
2. `.feluda.toml` configuration file
3. Default values

### Default Restrictive Licenses

By default, Feluda considers the following licenses as restrictive:
- GPL-3.0
- AGPL-3.0
- LGPL-3.0
- MPL-2.0
- SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE
- CC-BY-SA-4.0
- EPL-2.0

### Configuration File

Create a `.feluda.toml` file in your project root to override the default restrictive licenses:

```toml
[licenses]
# Override the default list of restrictive licenses
restrictive = [
    "GPL-3.0",      # GNU General Public License v3.0
    "AGPL-3.0",     # GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
    "Custom-1.0",   # Your custom license identifier
]
```

### Environment Variables

You can also override the configuration using environment variables:

```sh
# Override restrictive licenses list
export FELUDA_LICENSES_RESTRICTIVE='["GPL-3.0","AGPL-3.0","Custom-1.0"]'
```

The environment variables take precedence over both the configuration file and default values.
