## License Compliance Files

Feluda can generate essential compliance files required for commercial software distribution and open source projects.

### NOTICE File

A **NOTICE file** is a concise summary document that provides attribution for third-party components:

- **Purpose**: Quick overview of all third-party components and their licenses
- **Content**: Organized by license type, lists all dependencies with their versions
- **Use Cases**:
  - Legal compliance documentation
  - Quick reference for license audits
  - Attribution requirements for many open source licenses

### THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES File

A **THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES file** provides comprehensive license documentation:

- **Purpose**: Complete legal documentation for all dependencies
- **Content**: Full license texts, compatibility analysis, package URLs, and copyright information
- **Use Cases**:
  - Commercial software distribution requirements
  - Legal compliance for enterprise applications
  - Due diligence for acquisitions and audits
  - App store submissions (iOS, Android, etc.)

### Why These Files Are Important

**Legal Protection**: Many open source licenses require attribution when redistributing code. These files ensure compliance and protect your organization from legal issues.

**Transparency**: Shows exactly what third-party code is included in your application, building trust with users and stakeholders.

**Commercial Readiness**: Essential for commercial software, enterprise deployments, and app store submissions.

**Audit Preparation**: Makes license audits faster and easier by providing all necessary documentation in standard formats.

### Important Legal Notice

**‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER**: Feluda is still in early stages. While we're trying to follow through all compliances, users are responsible for:

- **Verifying accuracy** of all license information
- **Ensuring compliance** with all applicable license terms
- **Consulting legal counsel** for license compliance matters
- **Checking official repositories** for up-to-date license information

Feluda and its contributors disclaim all warranties and are not liable for any legal issues arising from the use of this information. **Use at your own risk.**

### When You Need These Files

- üì± **Mobile app distribution** (iOS App Store, Google Play)
- üè¢ **Enterprise software deployment**
- üíº **Commercial product releases**
- üîç **Legal compliance audits**
- ü§ù **Open source project attribution**
- üìÑ **Regulatory compliance** (GDPR, SOX, etc.)

## Output Format

### JSON

- Default: Plain text.
- JSON: Use the `--json` flag for JSON output.

```sh
feluda --json
```

Sample Output for a sample cargo.toml file containing `serde` and `tokio` dependencies:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "serde",
    "version": "1.0.151",
    "license": "MIT",
    "is_restrictive": false,
    "compatibility": "Compatible",
    "osi_status": "Approved"
  },
  {
    "name": "tokio",
    "version": "1.0.2",
    "license": "MIT",
    "is_restrictive": false,
    "compatibility": "Compatible",
    "osi_status": "Approved"
  }
]
```

### YAML

Use the `--yaml` flag for YAML output

```sh
feluda --yaml
```

Sample Output for a sample cargo.toml file containing `serde` and `tokio` dependencies:

```yaml
- name: serde
  version: 1.0.151
  license: MIT
  is_restrictive: false
  compatibility: Compatible
  osi_status: Approved
- name: tokio
  version: 1.0.2
  license: MIT
  is_restrictive: false
  compatibility: Compatible
  osi_status: Approved
```

### Gist Mode

For a short summary, in case you don't want all that output covering your screen:

```sh
feluda --gist
```

<img width="610" height="257" alt="feluda-gist" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51224a92-678d-4cd6-8a18-45a4e67f97f2" />

### Verbose Mode

For detailed information about each dependency:

```sh
feluda --verbose
```

The verbose mode displays a table with an additional "OSI Status" column showing whether each license is approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).

### OSI Integration

Feluda integrates with the Open Source Initiative (OSI) to provide license approval status information. This feature helps you identify whether the licenses used by your dependencies are officially approved by the OSI.

#### OSI Status Values

- **`approved`**: License is officially approved by the OSI
- **`unknown`**: License status with OSI is unknown or the license is not OSI approved

#### OSI Filtering

Filter dependencies by their OSI approval status:

```sh
# Show only OSI approved licenses
feluda --osi approved --verbose

# Show only non-approved or unknown OSI status licenses
feluda --osi not-approved --verbose

# Show licenses with unknown OSI status
feluda --osi unknown --verbose

# Combine with JSON output
feluda --osi approved --json
```

**Note**: OSI status information is only displayed in `--verbose` mode, `--gui` mode, or when using structured output formats (JSON/YAML) to keep the default output clean.

### License Compatibility

Feluda can check if dependency licenses are compatible with your project's license:

```sh
feluda --project-license MIT
```

You can also filter for incompatible licenses only:

```sh
feluda --incompatible
```

And fail CI builds if incompatible licenses are found:

```sh
feluda --fail-on-incompatible
```

### Strict Mode

In case you strictly need only the restrictive dependencies:

```sh
feluda --strict
```

### Terminal User Interface (TUI) Mode

We've an awesome ‚ú® TUI mode available to browse through the dependencies in a visually appealing way as well:

```sh
feluda --gui
```

![ss-gui](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f946fb1e-a36b-428b-b79f-90da0beface2)

## CI/CD Integration

Feluda provides several options for CI integration:

- `--ci-format <github|jenkins>`: Generate output compatible with the specified CI system
- `--fail-on-restrictive`: Make the CI build fail when restrictive licenses are found
- `--fail-on-incompatible`: Make the CI build fail when incompatible licenses are found
- `--osi <approved|not-approved|unknown>`: Filter by OSI license approval status
- `--output-file <path>`: Write the output to a file instead of stdout

Feluda can be easily integrated into your CI/CD pipelines with built-in support for **GitHub Actions** and **Jenkins**.

### GitHub Actions

To use Feluda with GitHub Actions, simply use the published action. For detailed documentation, see the [GitHub Action README](./ACTION-README.md).

```yaml
name: License Check

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  license-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

## Configuration (Optional)

Feluda allows you to customize which licenses are considered restrictive through configuration. This can be done in three ways, listed in order of precedence (highest to lowest):

1. Environment variables
2. `.feluda.toml` configuration file
3. Default values

### Default Restrictive Licenses

By default, Feluda considers the following licenses as restrictive:
- GPL-3.0
- AGPL-3.0
- LGPL-3.0
- MPL-2.0
- SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE
- CC-BY-SA-4.0
- EPL-2.0

### Configuration File

Create a `.feluda.toml` file in your project root to override the default restrictive licenses:

```toml
[licenses]
# Override the default list of restrictive licenses
restrictive = [
    "GPL-3.0",      # GNU General Public License v3.0
    "AGPL-3.0",     # GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
    "Custom-1.0",   # Your custom license identifier
]
```

### Environment Variables

You can also override the configuration using environment variables:

```sh
# Override restrictive licenses list
export FELUDA_LICENSES_RESTRICTIVE='["GPL-3.0","AGPL-3.0","Custom-1.0"]'
```

The environment variables take precedence over both the configuration file and default values.

## License Compatibility Matrix

Feluda uses a comprehensive license compatibility matrix to determine whether dependency licenses are compatible with your project's license. This matrix is maintained in an external TOML configuration file for easy updates and maintenance.

### How It Works

When you use the `--project-license` flag or Feluda auto-detects your project license, it checks each dependency's license against a compatibility matrix to determine:
- ‚úÖ **Compatible**: Safe to use with your project license
- ‚ùå **Incompatible**: May create legal issues or licensing conflicts  
- ‚ùì **Unknown**: License compatibility cannot be determined

### Compatibility Matrix Location

The license compatibility rules are stored in:

```sh
config/license_compatibility.toml
```

This file defines which dependency licenses are compatible with each project license type. For example:

```toml
[MIT]
compatible_with = [
    "MIT",
    "BSD-2-Clause", 
    "BSD-3-Clause",
    "Apache-2.0",
    "ISC",
    # ... more permissive licenses
]

[GPL-3.0]
compatible_with = [
    "MIT",
    "BSD-2-Clause",
    "Apache-2.0",
    "LGPL-2.1",
    "LGPL-3.0", 
    "GPL-2.0",
    "GPL-3.0",
    # ... GPL-compatible licenses
]
```

### Supported Project Licenses

The matrix currently supports compatibility checking for:
- **MIT** - Most permissive, allows only permissive dependency licenses
- **Apache-2.0** - Permissive license compatible with most open source licenses
- **GPL-3.0** - Copyleft license with broad compatibility including LGPL and other GPL versions
- **GPL-2.0** - Stricter copyleft (cannot include Apache-2.0 dependencies)
- **AGPL-3.0** - Network copyleft with GPL-3.0 compatibility plus AGPL
- **LGPL-3.0 / LGPL-2.1** - Lesser GPL variants with limited compatibility
- **MPL-2.0** - Mozilla Public License with moderate compatibility
- **BSD-3-Clause / BSD-2-Clause** - BSD variants with permissive-only compatibility
- **ISC, 0BSD, Unlicense, WTFPL** - Various permissive licenses

### Custom Compatibility Rules

Advanced users can customize compatibility rules by:

1. **User-specific overrides**: Create `.feluda/license_compatibility.toml` in your home directory
2. **Project-specific rules**: The local `config/license_compatibility.toml` takes precedence

**Important**: Modifying compatibility rules requires legal expertise. Consult legal counsel before making changes that could affect your project's compliance.

### Limitations and Disclaimers

‚ö†Ô∏è **Legal Disclaimer**: The license compatibility matrix is provided as a helpful tool, but:
- **Not legal advice**: Always consult qualified legal counsel for license compliance
- **Your responsibility**: Users must verify all license compatibility decisions  
- **No warranty**: Feluda and its contributors provide no warranties regarding license compatibility
- **Complexity**: License compatibility can depend on specific use cases, distribution methods, and jurisdictions
