### Releasing Feluda ðŸš€

This is only if you've release permissions. If not, contact the maintainers to get it.

#### Setup Requirements

- Install the gh CLI:
```sh
brew install gh # macOS
sudo apt install gh # Ubuntu/Debian
```

- Authenticate the gh CLI with GitHub:
```sh
gh auth login
```

- Install jq for JSON parsing:
```sh
brew install jq # macOS
sudo apt install jq # Ubuntu/Debian
```

We'll be using justfile for next steps, so setup [just](https://github.com/casey/just) before proceeding...

#### Build the Release
```sh
just release
```

#### Test the Release Build
```sh
just test-release
```

#### Create the Package
Validate the crate before publishing
```sh
just package
```

#### Publish the Crate
```sh
just publish
```

#### Automate Everything
Run all steps (build, test, package, and publish) in one command:

```sh
just release-publish
```

#### Clean Artifacts
To clean up the build artifacts:

```sh
just clean
```

#### Login to crates.io
```sh
