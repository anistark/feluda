Meet Feluda
===========

.. rst-class:: lead

   Feluda is the calm, methodical detective who surveys every dependency so you can ship with confidence.

Feluda, named after Satyajit Ray’s iconic sleuth, now prowls through source trees instead of Calcutta’s alleys.
He spots inconsistencies across Rust, Node, Go, Python, C/C++, .NET, and R stacks while keeping the story tidy.
You remain the trusted companion who decides when to dig deeper, escalate findings, or simply nod in approval.

Feluda’s satchel carries scanning commands, filters, SBOM builders, cache tools, and CI integrations covered throughout this guide.
Each section ends with practical next steps so you can move from manual spot checks to automated compliance quickly.
